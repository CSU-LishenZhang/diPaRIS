DiPaRIS requires two types of inputs: sequence and structural information. 
positive_seq and negative_seq samples' sequence information is extracted from eCLIP-seq data provided by the ENCODE database. 
positive_str and negative_str samples' structural information is extracted from icSHAPE-seq data provided by Zhang's lab.
