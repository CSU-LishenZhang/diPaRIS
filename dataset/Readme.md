DiPaRIS requires two types of inputs: **sequence** and **structural** information.   
```positive_seq``` and ```negative_seq``` sequence information is extracted from **eCLIP-seq** data provided by the **ENCODE database** (https://www.encodeproject.org/).  
```positive_str``` and ```negative_str``` structural information is extracted from **icSHAPE-seq** data provided by **Zhang's lab** (http://prismnet.zhanglab.net/).
