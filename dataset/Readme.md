To train model with diPaRIS requires input data organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific protein and cell line combination (e.g., `/AKAP1-HepG2`). The model takes two types of input: sequence and structural information. The sequence data (`positive_seq` and `negative_seq`) is extracted from eCLIP-seq experiments, available through the ENCODE database (https://www.encodeproject.org/). The structural data (`positive_str` and `negative_str`) is derived from icSHAPE-seq, provided by Zhang's lab (http://prismnet.zhanglab.net/).
